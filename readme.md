Podcast out of Thanissaro Bhikkhu's morning talks. Takes mp3s from https://www.dhammatalks.org/mp3_short_index.html and create podcast rss.

Podcast rss should be available here (updated every hour): 
http://jirinadvornik.com/morning-talks-metta-forest/morning_talks.rss

## TODO:
- put it into itunes, or somewhere, so it can be found from podcast appg
- add date of recording
- there are sometimes links to some extended material (pdfs with articles) that this script ignores.
- fix decoding of titles: "Attention to WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s Close"
- maybe add length of episodes.

## Notes for myself:
```
conda activate morning-talks

```
