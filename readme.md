Podcast out of Thanissaro Bhikkhu's morning talks. Takes mp3s from https://www.dhammatalks.org/mp3_short_index.html and create podcast rss.

Podcast rss should be available here: 
http://jirinadvornik.com/morning_talks.rss

## TODO:
- put on my website
- do some kind of caching.
- put it into itunes, or somewhere, so it can be found from podcast app


## Notes for myself:
```
conda activate morning-talks

```
